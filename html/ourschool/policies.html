    <h2 class="w3-wide"><b>Code of Behaviour</b></h2>
    <p class="w3-opacity">The Code of Behavior is reviewed annually and is designed to maintain good order and discipline within the school. The Code of Behaviour is based on the theme of respect for all and is developed in line with the school mission statement.</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">


		<h5><b>Our vision for relationships and behaviour in the school</b>
		</h5>


		Our school is committed to providing the best possible education for all our students. We aim to create a community of learners: showing respect, tolerance and care, valuing and celebrating diversity and actively promoting inclusion for all. We are committed to creating a happy, safe and orderly environment, where our students can develop into motivated and self disciplined young people. Recognising, encouraging and reinforcing positive behaviour is seen as more important in the school community than emphasis on negative consequences. As far as possible, incidences of misbehaviour are used as teaching opportunities and learning experiences. The following code outlines the behaviours we expect from students and the sanctions that will result from misconduct. This code has been accepted by students, teachers and parents as the best way to pursue our school aims and objectives.


		<h5><b>Respect for All</b>
		</h5>
		In our school everybody is valued. Differences of any type do not make it acceptable to bully a person. Silence allows people to suffer so we speak out when we know we should. The members of our school community have the right to be themselves and the responsibility to treat others as they themselves would like to be treated.

		Admission Policies</b>
		</h3>

		Students are accepted to the school under the conditions of our Admissions Policy available on request. Every student and parent/guardian must read and accept the Code of Behaviour and Respect on enrolment to the school
		<br><br>

		<h3><b>Code of Behaviour and Respect</b></h3>
		Our discipline system is based on a pastoral approach and focuses on student affirmation. Breaches of school rules wil be dealt with by class teachers with support of the Year Head and Care team if required. More serious braches of school rules will be dealt with by Year Heads, Deputy Principal and Principal according the the Code of Behaviour and Respect and Anti-bullying policy. At the beginning of each year, parents and students will also sign their school journal indicating that they have read and accept the Code of Behaviour and Respect. The underlining principle of our code is respect for self, others and school and other's property.
		<br><br>

		<h3><b>Homework and Study Ethos</b></h3>
		Our school policies reflect the importance placed on creating excellent learning opportunities for all students.
		Research shows that a good study routine leads to good results and so every effort is made to facilitate and promote this, both during and after school. Supervised study provides a good environment to stuudy for those who  wish to participate. Saturday study will also be arranged for the second and third term of each year.
